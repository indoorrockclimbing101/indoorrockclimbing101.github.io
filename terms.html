            <h3>Auto-belay</h3>
            <p>
                A device that allows climbers to climb without a belay partner.
                The tether hooks to the harness and lets the climber down slowly if they fall or choose to descend.
            </p>
            <h3>Belay</h3>
            <p>
                A type of climbing that uses two individuals connected by a rope to avoid injury when descending.
                One person climbs while the other stays on the ground.
                The person on the ground watches to see if the climber is going to descend and uses the rope system to control their descent.
            </p>
            <h3>Beta</h3>
            <p>
                Information about the climb that is helpful for completing the wall.
                For example, what techniques are best and when to use them.
            </p>
            <h3>Crux</h3>
            <p>
                The hardest part of the climb.
            </p>
            <h3>Dyno</h3>
            <p>
                A jump, in any direction, to make it to the next hold.
            </p>
            <h3>Flash</h3>
            <p>
                A climber's first attempt at a climb.
            </p>
            <h3>Project</h3>
            <p>
                A climb that a climber attempts for an extended period of time.
                This means that the climb is too difficult for the climber to complete in one day but is likely possible to complete over time after numerous attempts.
            </p>
            <h3>Send</h3>
            <p>
                When a climber completes a climb.
