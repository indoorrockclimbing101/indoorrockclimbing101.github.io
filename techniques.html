            <h2 class="container">Tips</h2>
            <p class="container underline">
                These do not technically fall under techniques but are helpful to know.
            </p>

            <h3 class="container">Straight arms</h3>
            <p class="container">
                Always try to keep arms straight. 
                This saves energy.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3 class="container">Keeping hips close to the wall</h3>
            <p class="container">
                By keeping hips close to the wall, climbers will not slip off the wall as easily or as quickly. 
                The climber’s center of weight becomes closer to the wall meaning it takes time to fall backwards. 
                Moreover, since their center of weight is closer to the wall, more weight is placed on their feet rather than their arms. 
                This helps save energy in the arms.
            </p>
            <p class="container-image container">

                <img src="/photos/techniques/hips_2.jpg" alt="Hips close to the wall" class="r-image">
            </p>

            <h3 class="container">Place more weight on the feet over the arms</h3>
            <p class="container">
                Legs are built for endurance while arms are not. 
                This is because legs always hold up the body while walking, running, etc. 
                By positioning the legs to take more of the weight, climbers can save energy and make moves easier to complete. 
                Feet are just as important as arms in climbing! 
            </p>

            <h3 class="container">Three-point contact</h3>
            <p class="container">
                Try to always imagine a triangle between the usual three points of contact—where each of the limbs are. 
                Only consider three points of contact because the last limb is reaching for the next hold. 
                The triangle formed by the limbs helps determine how easy the movement is. 
                The general rule is that the wider the base, the easier the movement of the last limb becomes. 
                The narrower the triangle is, the more pressure required for the climber to stay on the wall. 
                Therefore, try to find ways to make a wider base. 
                Keep in mind that this does not apply to all climbs because of dynos or less than the three points of contact on the wall.
            </p>

            <h2 class="container">Techniques</h2>

            <p class="container">
                For some of the techniques, I will be including physics explanations for them.
                Here are some key terms and some things to know while you view the images and read the explanations.
            </p>

            <p class="container">
                Changes in the color of the force vectors do not have any significance. 
                This just helps make the arrows more visible.
                However, dotted arrows represent the force being applied by the climber.
                This is important because applied force should be recognized but is not included on the free body diagrams (the images with just a circle, arrows, and labels).
            </p>

            <h3 class="container">Key terms for physics explanations:</h3>
            <p class="container">
                Normal force – the force from a surface against the thing applying a force. 
                For example, when a climber presses down on a hold, not only does the climber apply a force onto the hold, but the hold also applies a force against the hand. 
                The normal force will always be equal and in the opposite direction of the force being applied.   
            </p>
            <p class="container">
                Weight – the force of gravity on an object.
            </p>
            <p class="container">
                Friction – the force that opposes movement when two surfaces are in contact. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="container underline normal">How friction is increased</h5>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Let's say your body starts slipping down because the weight force is greater than the total friction force.
                    You can increase the friction force by applying more force to the holds. 
                    This is because the friction force increases as the normal force increases. 
                    The normal force is always equivalent to the force being applied to the surface and therefore increases as more force is applied to the surface.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="container">Bat hang</h3>
            <p class="container">

            <p class="container">

            <p class="container">
                Placing one’s feet on two different walls to hold oneself up.

            <p class="container">

            <h4 class="container underline normal">The different forces involved</h5>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    The force applied (A<sub>L</sub> and A<sub>R</sub>) from the hands results in two types of forces: normal force (N<sub>L</sub> and N<sub>R</sub>) and friction (F<sub>L</sub> and F<sub>R</sub>). 
                    Normal force (N<sub>L</sub> and N<sub>R</sub>) is the force applied from the hold against the hand. 
                    It is equivalent to the amount of force applied from the hand (N<sub>L</sub> = F<sub>L</sub> and N<sub>R</sub> = F<sub>R</sub>). 
                    Friction (F<sub>L</sub> and F<sub>R</sub>) is the force that opposes movement when two surfaces are in contact, which happens between the hands and the holds. 
                    The movement friction opposes is gravity pulling the body downwards, which is known as the weight force (W). 
                    The sum of the friction force from both hands and holds is enough to resist the weight force and therefore keeps the body stable or in other words in static equilibrium (F<sub>L</sub> + F<sub>R</sub> = W).

            <p class="container">
